## Poster Abstract

### Title

Redliner: An Activity Monitor for Manual Wheelchair Users

### Background

Activity monitors such as those produced by FitBit and Garmin are popular amongst the general population, however despite their usefulness in healthy living they are unsuitable for wheelchair users as they do not measure wheelchair propulsion. While the SmartWheel is an existing wheelchair activity monitor, it is prohibitively expensive and intrusive for personal use.

### Objective

The objective of this work was to create a low-cost manual wheelchair activity monitor capable of measuring parameters relating to activity level while also monitoring and notifying the user of damaging over-exertion events, fulfilling the role of personal activity monitor for wheelchair users.

### Method

The Redliner device uses a novel non-intrusive sensor which attaches to a user's wheel and measures the wheelchair's motion. A wheelchair-specific propulsion algorithm was developed which counts pushes, estimates distance travelled and time spent active, and enumerates overexertion events in real-time onboard the device.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Redliner device, a series of trials collecting a minimum of 3 pushes on various surfaces including linoleum, grass, gravel, and rough pavement were performed while collecting synchronous SmartWheel data. These surfaces were chosen to represent real-world wheelchair propulsion situations which could prove difficult for the device.

### Result

Kinematic data produced by the Redliner device was found to be in good agreement with the SmartWheel, with only slight losses in accuracy on extremely rough surfaces. Parameters reported by the propulsion algorithm closely matched experimental conditions.

### Conclusion

Redliner is a novel device for wheelchair users which has been proven effective for activity and over-exertion monitoring.
